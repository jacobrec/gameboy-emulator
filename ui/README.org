You must have built the wasm bundle before you run this. ~npm run
build~ will do that for you. Run ~npm run build~ or ~wasm-pack build~
in the emulator directory each time you change the rust code. ~npm run
build~ also sets up required sym links. This only needs to be done
once.

*** 🛠️ Build with ~npm run build~
    ~npm run build~

*** 🔬 Test in with ~npm start~
    ~npm start~
